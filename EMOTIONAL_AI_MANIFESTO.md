# AudioMIX Ethical AI Manifesto

AudioMIX is not just software. It's a statement.

It was born from frustration with bloated, inaccessible, and emotionally disconnected creative tools — and built with intention, modularity, and humanity at its core.

I built AudioMIX for the artists, rebels, neurodivergent builders, and audio dreamers who want to create freely without being surveilled, sold to, or boxed in.

## Our Philosophy

- **Creativity belongs to the creator.**  
  AI should never overwrite the voice of the artist — it should amplify, not replace.

- **Transparency over black-box magic.**  
  AudioMIX’s systems are modular, visible, and hackable by design.

- **Tool, not oracle.**  
  The AI elements in AudioMIX are designed to assist, not dictate.  
  You are always the one in control.

- **Local-first, cloud-optional.**  
  Wherever possible, AudioMIX respects privacy and user autonomy. You don’t need to be online to make magic.

- **Code is emotional.**  
  We believe software can be beautiful, empathetic, even healing — not just “functional.”

### A Note to the Community

AudioMIX will grow, and I welcome contributors — but only those who align with this ethos. This project is about empowerment, not exploitation. If you're building with AI, build with care. Build with clarity. Build with people in mind.

And most importantly?

**Build something that feels alive.**
