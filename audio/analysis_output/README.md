# Analysis Output (Intentionally Tracked)

The files in this directory are intentionally tracked as examples to showcase
AudioMIX's audio feature extraction and analysis pipeline.

They are intentionally tracked and serve as:
- reference material during DSP and ML development
- demonstrative artifacts for readers of the repository
- sanity checks when tuning feature extraction or inference logic
- a showcase of the data AudioMIX produces internally

The contents of this directory are **not required** to run AudioMIX and can be regenerated
at any time from source audio using the analysis tools.

**AudioMIX** favors transparency over black-box behavior and showing the intermediate data
is part of that philosophy.
