# AudioScript (AS) Language Specification & Syntax Support

Welcome to the `audioscript/` directory - the official home of the **AudioScript (AS)** domain-specific language used in [AudioMIX](https://github.com/alexisvassquez/ai_spotibot_player). **AudioScript** is a modular, *expressive*, and now **functional-reactive** scripting language designed to power **real-time music behavior, emotional audio cues, light-reactive visuals, and live performance logic** directly from the AS terminal.

> üéõÔ∏è  AudioScript is for those who feel sound, code emotion, and live at the intersection of creativity and computation.

## Syntax Highlighting Setup (Nano)

To enable syntax highlighting for **AudioScript (AS)** in Nano:

1. Copy `audioscript.nanorc` into your Nano config directory:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.nano
cp audioscript.nanorc ~/.nano.
```

2. Add the following line to you `~/.nanorc`:
```bash
include ~/.nano/audioscript.nanorc
```

3. Open your `.as` or `.audioscript` files like this:
```bash
nano -Y audioscript example.as
```

## About the Language

**AudioScript** syntax blends the *minimalism of Bash*, the *readability of Python*, and now the *lazy functional power of Haskell*. It is engineered for low-latency music programming, enabling instant response in performance - whether you're syncing audio, controlling LED arrays, or programming mood-reactive stage effects.

Core design influences:
- **Python** - for intuitive scripting and flow control
- **Haskell** - lazy evaluation, functional purity, infinite pattern generation
- **Shell/Bash** - for command-style expressiveness and minimalism
- **C / C++** - for speed, performance modules, PortAudio control
- **CMake** - for declarative, configuration-style logic

### üí° New v0.2 Capabilities:
- `let` expressions for variable storage (`let beat = repeat(["kick", "snare"])`)
- Lazy generators with `repeat()` and `take()`
- Function chaining with `with` (`play("track") with reverb + stutter(2)`)
- Pure function utilities (from `runtime/dsl_helpers.py`)
- Runtime context and event hook management
- CLI-based `.audioscript` and `.as` execution and interactive shell

### Core Commands:
- `play()`, `pause()`, `stop()`, `rewind()` - Real-time audio control
- `glow()`, `pulse()`, `fade()` - Light + LED behavior
- `mood.set()` - Emotionally-reactive state transitions
- `let`, `def`, `on mood(...)` - Functional and reactive control flow

Declared file extensions:
- `.audioscript`
- `.as`
